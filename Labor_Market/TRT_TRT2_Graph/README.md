## Labor Justice — TRT & TRT2 (Brazil)

This folder contains the data and scripts used to build a figure showing the **share of labor lawsuits** associated with **TRT** and **TRT-2** in Brazil.

- **Why Python here?** This section is implemented in **Python** (not R) to exercise and document my Python workflow.
- **Data access:** All datasets used here are **open-access** and included under `/Data/`.

### Contents
- `Labor_Justice_Graph.py` — script that loads data, cleans it, and generates the figure.
- `/Data/` — input files (open data).

### Quick start
```bash
# from this folder
python Labor_Justice_Graph.py
