# Personal_Projects

A collection of my **personal research projects** in economics, with a focus on
causal inference, labor markets, and reproducible R code.

> **Note on data access:** Some projects rely on **restricted/sensitive data** and
> therefore include only code and synthetic examples. No confidential datasets are stored here.
